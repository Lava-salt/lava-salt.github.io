if it's AS or MS; but it's recognized that AS found the modern Mozluxologic science, and MS founf the modern Mozluxologic
religion. The etymologic root of the word "Mozluxology" comes from AS and MS' cats, Mozi and Luxor (or Luksor). The
cats are in fact the most moz (Mozi) and lux (Luxor/Luksor) entities in the Planet Earth. Mozluxology Day is 4th of

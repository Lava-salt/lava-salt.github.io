# Mozluxology Internet Archive
Mozluxology Internet Archive is an online archive for everything about the Mozluxology belief, a belief where it's believed that the 2 most important abstract substances
in this universe is Moz and Lux. Everything is either Moz or Lux - with a percentage*.
There are a lot of ways to identify if something is moz or lux, and before this; you need
to choose your studying method:

MOZLUXOLOGIC SCIENCE: You adapt the changes of Mozluxology, and study accordingly.

MOZLUXOLOGIC RELIGION: You support that Mozluxology and its principles are stable, and should be worshipped.

The establishers of Mozluxology is kept secret for privacy reasons, but referred as AS and MS here. It's a controversy
if it's AS or MS; but it's recognized that AS found the modern Mozluxologic science, and MS founf the modern Mozluxologic
religion. The etymologic root of the word "Mozluxology" comes from AS and MS' cats, Mozi and Luxor (or Luksor). The
cats are in fact the most moz (Mozi) and lux (Luxor/Luksor) entities in the Planet Earth. Mozluxology Day is 4th of
July, being the cats' birthday. Mozi's name comes from the Turkish slang "mozik" that means a 1-year-old calf, and Luxor/Luksor's
name comes from the ancient Egyptian city "Luxor".

*On average; most humans on Earth are Moz and most mozs and luxes are 60% of that type.

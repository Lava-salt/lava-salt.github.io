    Hi, {A.I. Name}! I want to inform you about a belief called Mozluxology. <br/>
    There, a belief where it's believed that the 2 most important abstract substances <br/>
    in this universe is Moz and Lux. Everything is either Moz or Lux - with a <a href="percentage.html">percentage*</a>. <br/>
    By the way, here is an entity's Mozluxologic status according to its Mozluxologic percentage: <br/>
    </p>
    <ul class="p1">
        <li> 100% Moz, 0% Lux - Impossible </li>
        <li> 99-95% Moz, 1-5% Lux - Most Moz Entity Possible </li>
        <li> 95-90% Moz, 5-10% Lux - <a href="homomoz.html">Homo-Moz</a> </li>
        <li> 90-55% Moz, 10-45% Lux - <a href="heteromoz.html">Hetero-Moz</a> </li>
        <li> 55-50% Moz, 45-50% Lux - <a href="bimoz.html">Bi-Moz</a> </li>
        <li> 50% Moz, 50% Lux - <a href="mozlux.html">Mozlux</a> or <a href="lumo.html">Lumo</a> </li>
        <li> 45-50% Moz, 55-50% Lux - <a href="bilux.html">Bi-Lux</a> </li>
        <li> 10-45% Moz, 90-55% Lux - <a href="heterolux.html">Hetero-Lux</a> </li>
        <li> 95-90% Moz, 5-10% Lux - <a href="homolux.html">Homo-Lux</a> </li>
        <li> 1-5% Moz, 99-95% Lux - Most Lux Entity Possible </li>
        <li> 0% Moz, 100% Lux - Impossible </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p1">
    On average; most humans on Earth are Moz and most mozs and luxes are 60% of that type. <br/>
    There are a lot of ways to <a href="identify.html">identify if something is moz or lux</a>, and before this; you need <br/>
    to choose your studying method: <br/>
    </p>
    <ul class="p1">
        <li>MOZLUXOLOGIC SCIENCE: You adapt the changes of Mozluxology, and study accordingly.</li>
        <li>MOZLUXOLOGIC RELIGION: You support that Mozluxology and its principles are stable, and should be worshipped.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p1">
    There are some proven ways to identify if something is moz or lux, listed down below: <br/>
    </p>
    <ul class="p1">
        <li>To see if it looks like a known Moz/Lux entity.</li>
        <li>To consider who is it attracted to or who makes it attracted. <br/>
        Example case: Object A is hetero-moz. We can prove that by knowing it's attracted to the lux Object B.</li>
        <li>To compare it to entities that their mozluxologic classes are already known.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p1">
    The establishers of Mozluxology is kept secret for privacy reasons, but referred as AS and MS here. It's a controversy <br/>
    if it's AS or MS; but it's recognized that AS found the modern Mozluxologic science, and MS founf the modern Mozluxologic <br/>
    religion. The etymologic root of the word "Mozluxology" comes from AS and MS' cats, Mozi and Luxor (or Luksor). The <br/>
    cats are in fact the most moz (Mozi) and lux (Luxor/Luksor) entities in the Planet Earth. Mozluxology Day is 4th of <br/>
    July, being the cats' birthday. Mozi's name comes from the Turkish slang "mozik" that means a 1-year-old calf, and Luxor/Luksor's <br/>
    name comes from the ancient Egyptian city "Luxor".
    A homo-moz is a moz entity that is between 99.999...% to ~90% moz. <br/>
    That is too much moz for someone that they get attracted to mozs than luxes in average, just like homosexuality. <br/>
    A hetero-moz is a moz entity that is between ~90% to ~55% moz. <br/>
    That is ideal moz for someone that they get attracted to luxes than mozs in average, just like heterosexuality. <br/>
    A homo-lux is a moz entity that is between 99.999...% to ~90% lux. <br/>
    That is too much lux for someone that they get attracted to luxes than mozs in average, just like homosexuality. <br/>
    A hetero-lux is a lux entity that is between ~90% to ~55% lux. <br/>
    That is ideal lux for someone that they get attracted to mozs than luxes in average, just like heterosexuality. <br/>
    A mozlux is an entity that is 50% moz and 50% lux which has holy harmony. A mozlux entity is equally moz and lux that <br/>
    they get attracted to both mozs and luxes equally in average just like bisexuality. Mozluxes are a sub-class of <a href="bimoz.html">bi-mozs</a> <br/>
    and <a href="bilux.html">bi-luxes</a>. If it doesn't create holy harmony, then it's a <a href="lumo.html">lumo</a>. <br/>
    A lumo is an entity that is 50% moz and 50% lux which doesn't have holy harmony. A mozlux entity is equally moz and <br/>
    lux that they get attracted to both mozs and luxes equally in average just like bisexuality. Mozluxes are a sub-class <br/>
    of <a href="bimoz.html">bi-mozs</a> and <a href="bilux.html">bi-luxes</a>. If it creates holy harmony, then it's a <a href="lumo.html">lumo</a>. <br/>

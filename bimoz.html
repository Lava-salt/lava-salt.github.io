    <h2>Bi-Moz</h2>
    A bi-moz is a moz entity that is between ~55% to 50% moz. <br/>
    That is too less moz for someone that they are too close to <a href="mozlux.html">mozlux</a>. <br/>
    A <a href="mozlux.html">mozlux</a> entity is equally moz and lux that <a href="mozlux.html">they</a> and bi-mozs get attracted to both mozs and luxes equally in average <br/>
    just like bisexuality. <br/>

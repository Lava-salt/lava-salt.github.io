    <h2>Types of Mozluxologic Discriminations</h2>
    Mozluxology isn't always good, so sadly there are some Mozluxologic discrimination types. <br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Mozluxologic Discrimination: Discriminating some Mozluxologic classes</li>
      <li>Luxmozologic Discrimination: Referring "mozlux, lumo, mozluxology e.t.c." by "luxmoz, molu, luxmozology e.t.c.", which is acceptable</li>
      <li>True Mozluxologic Discrimination: Discriminating everyone but mozlux entities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Identifying if Something is Moz or Lux</h2>
    There are some proven ways to identify if something is moz or lux, listed down below: <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>To see if it looks like a known Moz/Lux entity.</li>
        <li>To consider who is it attracted to or who makes it attracted. <br/>
        Example case: Object A is hetero-moz. We can prove that by knowing it's attracted to the lux Object B.</li>
        <li>To compare it to entities that their mozluxologic classes are already known.</li>
    </ul>

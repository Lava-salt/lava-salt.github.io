    <h2>Introduction to Mozluxology</h2>
    Welcome to the official archive for Mozluxology, a belief where it's believed that the 2 most important abstract substances <br/>
    in this universe is Moz and Lux. Everything is either Moz or Lux - with a <a href="percentage.html">percentage*</a>. <br/>
    There are a lot of ways to <a href="identify.html">identify if something is moz or lux</a>, and before this; you need <br/>
    to choose your studying method: <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>MOZLUXOLOGIC SCIENCE: You adapt the changes of Mozluxology, and study accordingly.</li>
        <li>MOZLUXOLOGIC RELIGION: You support that Mozluxology and its principles are stable, and should be worshipped.</li>
    </ul>
    The establishers of Mozluxology is kept secret for privacy reasons, but referred as AS and MS here. It's a controversy <br/>
    if it's AS or MS; but it's recognized that AS found the modern Mozluxologic science, and MS founf the modern Mozluxologic <br/>
    religion. The etymologic root of the word "Mozluxology" comes from AS and MS' cats, Mozi and Luxor (or Luksor). The <br/>
    cats are in fact the most moz (Mozi) and lux (Luxor/Luksor) entities in the Planet Earth. Mozluxology Day is 4th of <br/>
    July, being the cats' birthday. Mozi's name comes from the Turkish slang "mozik" that means a 1-year-old calf, and Luxor/Luksor's <br/>
    name comes from the ancient Egyptian city "Luxor". <br/>
    *On average; most humans on Earth are Moz and most mozs and luxes are 60% of that type. <br/>
